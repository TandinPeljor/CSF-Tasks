# In Python, defining a function does not automatically execute it.
# A function must be called to be executed.
# If a function is defined but not called, nothing will be displayed.
# In the task, the function greet is defined to print "hello there". 
# However, the function is never called in the code, 
# So the print statement inside it is never executed, and nothing is displayed.

def greet():
    print("hello there")
