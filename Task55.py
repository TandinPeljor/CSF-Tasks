def greet():
    print("hello there")
greet()

# When we run the above code, Python executes the greet function and displays "hello there". 
# This is because the function greet contains a print statement that prints "hello there" when the function is called

#def hi()
#    A = 7
#    print()
#hi()


def hi():
    A = 7
    print(A)
